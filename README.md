## How It Works

Eartho serves as a privacy-focused layer between users and major authentication providers like Google, Facebook, and others. When users log in using Eartho, they can still choose popular sign-in options such as **Google Sign-In** or **Facebook Login**, but with a critical difference: **Big Tech companies will no longer have access to your users’ data**.

### Key Process:
1. **User Login**: 
   - When a user selects a login option (e.g., Google or Facebook), Eartho wraps the process, acting as an intermediary between the user and the authentication provider.
   
2. **Eartho as the Provider**:
   - While users still authenticate via their preferred service, Eartho handles the interaction and prevents the original provider (Google, Facebook, etc.) from seeing the internal application logic, user actions, or any personal data beyond what’s required for authentication.

3. **Data Protection**:
   - All authentication data is encrypted and protected by Eartho. Big Tech providers can only process the basic login flow, but they cannot track the user's activity, personal preferences, or any other data within the app. Eartho ensures your users’ privacy by restricting data access only to the login process.

4. **Seamless Integration**:
   - Eartho offers an easy-to-integrate solution for developers, requiring minimal changes to the existing login system. Your users will enjoy the same familiarity with major login providers, but with the added benefit of enhanced privacy and security through Eartho.

By wrapping major sign-in services, Eartho provides the best of both worlds: the convenience of popular authentication providers and the security of true privacy for users, ensuring that no personal data leaks to third-party companies.

## Why Eartho?

In today’s digital age, privacy is paramount. Most single sign-on (SSO) providers collect data from users and track their online activity. **Eartho** solves this problem by offering a sign-in solution that ensures users’ privacy remains intact.

Developers can integrate Eartho with a few lines of code and provide users with:
- Secure login options
- Control over what data they share and with whom
- A unified account management system with multiple login methods
- Protection from Big Tech tracking and surveillance

Eartho is built for developers who care about privacy and security, but don't want to compromise on ease of use.

## **Tech Stack** ⚙️

- **Backend**: Next.js API for authentication + Node.js to manage overall data and endpoints
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React)
- **Database**: Firestore(Should be replaced)
- **Cloud**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0, JWT

- **Auth.js**: Our one module use auth.js

- **Multiple Authentication Options**: Give your users the freedom to log in with **Google, Facebook, Apple**, **GitHub**, or even **MetaMask**—while keeping their data private.
- **Easy Integration**: Eartho simplifies the development process for login, sign-up, and profile management pages. With just one line of code, you can integrate Eartho seamlessly into your app.
- **No Migration Needed**: Continue using existing authentication providers without the need to migrate users or disrupt their experience. Eartho enhances privacy while keeping everything intact.
- **Advanced Security Features**: Eartho comes with an **advanced antifraud system**, using on-device machine learning to verify user authenticity and prevent fraud.

### **How to Add Eartho**
1. **Install the SDK**  
   Begin by installing the Eartho SDK via npm or yarn:
   ```bash
   npm install @eartho/one-client-js
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn add @eartho/one-client-js
   ```

2. **Initialize Eartho in Your App**

       redirect_uri: 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URI'
   });
   ```

3. **Add Login and Logout Features**  
   Implement login and logout functionality to allow users to sign in or out securely:
   ```javascript
   function login() {
       eartho.connectWithPopup().then(result => {
           console.log('Logged in as:', result.token);
           console.log('Logged in as:', result.user);

           auth0/nextauth/firebase/supabase/clerk.loginWithCustomToken(result.token.)
       }).catch(err => {
           console.error('Login failed:', err);
       });
   }

   function logout() {
       eartho.disconnect();
   }
   ```

4. **Integrate Eartho Pay**

### **Popular Authentication Providers:**
- **Google**: Log in with your Google account for seamless access.
- **Apple**: Use your Apple ID for secure and private authentication.
- **Facebook**: Sign in through Facebook while keeping your data private from Big Tech.
- **Twitter (X)**: Authenticate with your Twitter (X) account and remain protected.
- **GitHub**: Ideal for developers logging in with their GitHub accounts.

### **Additional Methods:**
- **Email**: Secure login via one-time password (OTP) sent to your email.
