  <h1>The Open-Source, <br /> Privacy-Focused Alternative to Google Sign-In</h1>
  <p>
    <b>Eartho</b> is an open-source authentication and user identity management system that prioritizes user privacy.
    It offers a flexible, secure, and privacy-first alternative to traditional login providers like Google Sign-In, Apple, or Facebook.
    Eartho ensures that users' personal data stays protected from Big Tech tracking, while developers benefit from a simple, easy-to-integrate solution.

## How It Works

Eartho serves as a privacy-focused layer between users and major authentication providers like Google, Facebook, and others. When users log in using Eartho, they can still choose popular sign-in options such as **Google Sign-In** or **Facebook Login**, but with a critical difference: **Big Tech companies will no longer have access to your users’ data**.

### Key Process:
1. **User Login**: 
   - When a user selects a login option (e.g., Google or Facebook), Eartho wraps the process, acting as an intermediary between the user and the authentication provider.
   
2. **Eartho as the Provider**:
   - While users still authenticate via their preferred service, Eartho handles the interaction and prevents the original provider (Google, Facebook, etc.) from seeing the internal application logic, user actions, or any personal data beyond what’s required for authentication.

3. **Data Protection**:
   - All authentication data is encrypted and protected by Eartho. Big Tech providers can only process the basic login flow, but they cannot track the user's activity, personal preferences, or any other data within the app. Eartho ensures your users’ privacy by restricting data access only to the login process.

4. **Seamless Integration**:
   - Eartho offers an easy-to-integrate solution for developers, requiring minimal changes to the existing login system. Your users will enjoy the same familiarity with major login providers, but with the added benefit of enhanced privacy and security through Eartho.

By wrapping major sign-in services, Eartho provides the best of both worlds: the convenience of popular authentication providers and the security of true privacy for users, ensuring that no personal data leaks to third-party companies.

## Why Eartho?

In today’s digital age, privacy is paramount. Most single sign-on (SSO) providers collect data from users and track their online activity. **Eartho** solves this problem by offering a sign-in solution that ensures users’ privacy remains intact.

Developers can integrate Eartho with a few lines of code and provide users with:
- Secure login options
- Control over what data they share and with whom
- A unified account management system with multiple login methods
- Protection from Big Tech tracking and surveillance

Eartho is built for developers who care about privacy and security, but don't want to compromise on ease of use.

## Authentication Methods Supported

Eartho supports a wide range of authentication methods, allowing users to log in using their preferred provider while ensuring their privacy is maintained. Below are the supported authentication methods that users can choose from:

### **Popular Authentication Providers:**
- **Google**: Log in with your Google account for seamless access.
- **Apple**: Use your Apple ID for secure and private authentication.
- **Facebook**: Sign in through Facebook while keeping your data private from Big Tech.
- **Twitter (X)**: Authenticate with your Twitter (X) account and remain protected.
- **GitHub**: Ideal for developers logging in with their GitHub accounts.

### **Additional Methods:**
- **Email**: Secure login via one-time password (OTP) sent to your email.
- **SMS**: Authenticate using a code sent directly to your phone via SMS.
- **VK**: Support for VK, a popular platform in Eastern Europe and Russia.
- **Reddit**: Login via Reddit for users active on the platform.
- **Yandex**: A secure login option through Yandex.
- **MetaMask**: For crypto enthusiasts, log in using your MetaMask wallet.
- **Wave**: Authentication via Wave for added flexibility.

### **How It Works**:
Eartho wraps these providers, acting as a privacy layer, which means your login process goes through Eartho. This ensures that while the authentication provider can verify your credentials, they don't gain access to your app activity or personal information—keeping your data safe and secure.
